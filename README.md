My first Rust program.  I wrote this to learn how to program with Rust.

This is an implementation of the Genetic Programming algorithm to find an equation matching a data set.

Set max_generations to -1 to run without checking max_generations.  Runs until fitness gets close to 0.

Hit return on keyboard to stop run, or ctl-c.
